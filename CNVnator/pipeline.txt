#This is the full pipeline of CNV analysis:

1. extract scaffolds:
python get_scaffolds.py tetraurelia
python get_scaffolds.py biaurelia
python get_scaffolds.py sexaurelia

2. Figure out what bin size to use for each species
tet: 100
bi: 
sex:
caud: 400

3. run cnvnator:
qsub run_cnvnator_tet.pbs

4.filter results:
#removes genes at the end of scaffolds:
python filter_results.py

5.get genes associated with each predicted region
get_genes.py 

#The distribution of deletions is basically normal-looking around 500-700 bp and then has a long tail for longer regions. I think the smaller regions must be more real, or of higher confidence.  

So use diff cutoffs- 1000bp, 2k, 4k, 6k and 10k

6. make a file of summary
python create_deletion_summary.py tetraurelia 1000

7. get characteristics of genes with deletions:
python get_deletion_charc.py tetraurelia 1000
